Employees are all people covered by a contractual arrangement, working in an enterprise and receiving compensation for their work. People on sick leave, paid leave or vacation are included, while working proprietors, active business partners, unpaid family workers and home workers are excluded. Employees with stable contracts are those who have had, and continue to have, an explicit or implicit contract of employment, or a succession of such contracts, with the same employer for a period longer than a specified national minimum (determined by a country's circumstances). Regular employees are those who have stable contracts, for whom the enterprise is responsible for payment of taxes and social security contributions, and/or for whom the contractual relationship is subject to national labour legislation. Enterprises can be classified as small or medium sized (less than 250 employees) or as large (250 or more employees). This indicator is measured as a percentage of employees in manufacturing.
