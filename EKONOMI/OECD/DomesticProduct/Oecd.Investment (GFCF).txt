Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) is defined as the acquisition (including purchases of new or second-hand assets) and creation of assets by producers for their own use, minus disposals of produced fixed assets. The relevant assets relate to products that are intended for use in the production of other goods and services for a period of more than a year. The term "produced assets" means that only those assets that come into existence as a result of a production process recognised in the national accounts are included. Data are internationally comparable by following the System of National Accounts. This indicator is in million USD at current prices and PPPs, and in annual growth rates.
