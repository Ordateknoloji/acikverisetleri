Asset types in this indicator include dwellings, other buildings and structures, transport equipment, ICT equipment, cultivated biological resources (such as breeding livestock or orchards) and Intellectual property product (such as mineral exploration, software or original artistic works). The scope of assets has been widened in the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) to include research and development and military weapons systems. "Dwellings" includes "Other buildings and structures" for Chile, Norway, Portugal and Turkey. It also includes "Cultivated assets" for Chile. "Cultivated assets" are not capitalised for Canada and the United States. "Transport equipment" is included in "Other machinery and equipment" for Australia, Chile and Turkey. "Ownership transfer costs" are included in the total assets but not in the breakdown for Australia and South Africa. The United Kingdom has improved its valuation of artistic originals, based on the sum of costs approach. Australia includes weapons systems in "Other machinery and equipment", the United States includes them in "Transport equipment" (missiles, tanks, etc.) and "Other machinery equipment" (electronic and other equipment). This indicator is measured as percentage of total gross fixed capital formation.
