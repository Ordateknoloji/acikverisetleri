Labour productivity growth is a key dimension of economic performance and an essential driver of changes in living standards. Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita can be broken down into growth in labour productivity, measured as growth in GDP per hour worked, and changes in the extent of labour utilisation, measured as changes in hours worked per capita. High labour productivity growth can reflect greater use of capital, and/or a decrease in the employment of low-productivity workers, or general efficiency gains and innovation.
