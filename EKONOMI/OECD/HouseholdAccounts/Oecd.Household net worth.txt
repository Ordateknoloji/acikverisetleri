Household total net worth is the value of total assets (the total amount of financial assets plus the total amount of non-financial assets, though in the case of the presented indicator it only takes into account the value of dwellings from non-financial assets) minus the total value of outstanding liabilities. Household financial net worth is the balancing item of their financial balance sheet, i.e. total financial assets minus total liabilities, recorded at current market values. The change in financial net worth between two consecutive years is not only due to financial transactions over the period, but also to price changes (i.e. holding gains or losses) in financial assets and liabilities. The following financial assets and liabilities are included, whenever available/applicable for households: Currency and deposits, Debt securities, Loans, Equity and investment fund shares/units, Insurance, pension and standardised guarantee programmes (including net equity of households in pension funds), Financial derivatives and Employee stock options and other accounts receivable and payable. The total is measured as a percentage of net disposable income. The financial is calculated as the ratio of financial net worth of households divided by the number of individuals in the country, in USD at current PPPs. Data are under System of National Accounts (SNA 1993) for all countries except for Australia and United States (SNA 2008).
