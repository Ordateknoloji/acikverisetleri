“Net financial transactions" is the balancing item of the financial accounts of the households. It is calculated as the difference, in a given period, between net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities, which correspond to the financial transactions taking place between households and Financial and non-financial corporations, General government and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) as well as the rest of the world. This indicator is measured as percentage of net household disposable income. Data are under System of National Accounts (SNA 1993) for all countries except for Australia and United States (SNA 2008).
