Both net lending or borrowing can be measured as the balancing item in either the capital or financial accounts. It can therefore be derived as saving less the balances on non-financial assets and capital transfers. Or it can be derived as the difference between net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities. Financial assets (and liabilities) include: monetary gold and special drawing rights, currency and deposits, debt securities, Loans, Equity and investment fund shares/units , Insurance, pension and standardised guarantee programmes (including net equity of households in pension funds), Financial derivatives and employee stock options and other accounts receivable and payable (such as trade credits and advances for work in progress or to be undertaken). This indicator is measured as percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).
