Value added reflects the contribution of labour and capital to production. Value added by activity breaks down the total value added by sector, namely agriculture, industry, utilities, and other service activities. The shares of each sector are calculated by dividing the value added in each sector by total value added. The breakdown of value added by activity has changed considerably over recent decades. The share of agriculture is now relatively small in almost all OECD countries. The share of industry has also fallen while services now account for well over 60% of total gross value added in most OECD countries.
