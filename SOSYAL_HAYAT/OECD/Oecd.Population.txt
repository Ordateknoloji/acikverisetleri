Population is defined as all nationals present in, or temporarily absent from a country, and aliens permanently settled in a country. This indicator shows the number of people that usually live in an area. Growth rates are the annual changes in population resulting from births, deaths and net migration during the year. Total population includes the following: national armed forces stationed abroad; merchant seamen at sea; diplomatic personnel located abroad; civilian aliens resident in the country; displaced persons resident in the country. However, it excludes the following: foreign armed forces stationed in the country; foreign diplomatic personnel located in the country; civilian aliens temporarily in the country. Population projections are a common demographic tool. They provide a basis for other statistical projections, helping governments in their decision making. This indicator is measured in terms of annual growth rate and in thousands of people.
