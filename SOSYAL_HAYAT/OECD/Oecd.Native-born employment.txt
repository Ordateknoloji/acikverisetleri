The native-born employment rate is calculated as the share of employed native-born persons aged 15-64 in the total native-born population (active and inactive persons) of that same age. Employed people are those who worked at least one hour or who had a job but were absent from work during the reference week. This indicator is measured in percentage of native-born population of the same age by gender.
