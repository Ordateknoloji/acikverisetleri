The youth population is defined as those people aged less than15. The share of the dependent population is calculated as total elderly and youth population expressed as a ratio of the total population. The youth-dependency ratio relates the number of young persons that are likely to be dependent on the support of others for their daily needs to the number of those who are capable of providing such support. Demographic trends have a number of implications for government and private spending on pensions, health care, and education, and, more generally, for economic growth and welfare. This indicator is measured as a percentage of population.
