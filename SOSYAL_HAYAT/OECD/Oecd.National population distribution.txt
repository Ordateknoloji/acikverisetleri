National population distribution is defined as the share of inhabitants by types of regions in a given country. Population is unevenly distributed among regions within countries. Differences in climate and environmental conditions discourage settlement in some areas and encourage concentrated settlement around a few urban centres. This pattern is reinforced by the greater economic opportunities and wider availability of services that stem from urbanisation itself. This indicator is measured as a percentage of the national population.
