Tax on payroll is defined as taxes paid by employers, employees or the self-employed, either as a proportion of payroll or as a fixed amount per person, and that do not confer entitlement to social benefits. Examples of such taxes include: the United Kingdom national insurance surcharge (introduced in 1977), the Swedish payroll tax (1969-79), and the Austrian Contribution to the Family Burden Equalisation Fund and Community Tax. This indicator relates to government as a whole (all government levels) and is measured in percentage both of GDP and of total taxation.
