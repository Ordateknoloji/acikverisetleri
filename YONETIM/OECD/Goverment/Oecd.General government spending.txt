General government spending, as a share of GDP and per person, provides an indication of the size of the government across countries. General government spending generally consists of central, state and local governments, and social security funds. The large variation in this indicator highlights the variety of countries' approaches to delivering public goods and services and providing social protection, not necessarily differences in resources spent. This indicator is measured in terms of thousand USD per capita and as a percentage of GDP. Data are under System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008) for all countries except for Chile, Japan and Turkey where data are under SNA 1993.
