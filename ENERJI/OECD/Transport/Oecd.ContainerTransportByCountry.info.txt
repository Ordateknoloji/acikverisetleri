Container transport refers to the transportation of goods in standardized re-sealable transportation boxes by rail and sea. Data are expressed in tons and twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU). TEU is based on a container of 20 foot length (6.10 m) providing a standardised measure of containers of various capacities and for describing the capacity of container ships or terminals. One 20 foot container equals 1 TEU.
