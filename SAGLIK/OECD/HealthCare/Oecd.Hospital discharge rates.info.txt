Hospital discharge rates measure the number of patients who leave a hospital after receiving care. Hospital discharge is defined as the release of a patient who has stayed at least one night in hospital. It includes deaths in hospital following inpatient care. Same-day discharges are usually excluded. This indicator is measured per 100 000 inhabitants.
