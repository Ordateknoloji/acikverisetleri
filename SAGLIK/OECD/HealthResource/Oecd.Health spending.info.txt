Health spending is defined as the final consumption of health goods and services. It includes spending by both public and private sources (including households) on curative, rehabilitative and long-term care as well as medical goods such as pharmaceuticals. It also covers spending on public health and prevention programmes, and on administration. This indicator is presented as a total and per financing agent (public, private and out-of-pocket expenditure) and is measured in percentage of GDP, in percentage of total expenditure on health, and in USD per capita (using PPP).
