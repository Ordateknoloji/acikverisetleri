This indicator presents data on deaths from cancer. There are more than 100 different types of cancers. For a large number of cancer types, the risk of developing the disease rises with age. Mortality rates are based on numbers of deaths registered in a country in a year divided by the size of the corresponding population. The rates have been directly age-standardised to the 2010 OECD population to remove variations arising from differences in age structures across countries and over time. The original source of the data is the WHO Mortality Database. This indicator is presented as a total and by gender. Cancer mortality is measured per 100 000 inhabitants (total), per 100 000 men and per 100 000 women.
